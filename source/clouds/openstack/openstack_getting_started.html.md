Here are the high-level steps to get you started with using OpenStack with RightScale.

1. View our support overview for OpenStack: [OpenStack](openstack_about.html)
3. Refer to our list of prerequisites for configuring your OpenStack private cloud with RightScale: [OpenStack Configuration Prerequisites](openstack_config_prereqs.html)
4. Register your OpenStack private cloud with a RightScale account: [Register an OpenStack Private Cloud with RightScale](openstack_register_an_openstack_private_cloud_with_rightscale.html)
5. Add a registered OpenStack private cloud to a RightScale account: [Add an OpenStack Private Cloud to a RightScale Account](openstack_add_an_openstack_private_cloud_to_a_rightscale_account.html)
6. Upload RightScale RightImages to your OpenStack private cloud: [Upload RightImages to an OpenStack Private Cloud](openstack_upload_rightimages_to_an_openstack_private_cloud.html)
7. Once you create a RightLink-enabled Image with RightScale, you must create a MultiCloud Image that points to that image. Then tag the MCI so RightScale recognizes it as an image with RightLink installed: [Create a MultiCloud Image](http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Dashboard_Users_Guide/Design/MultiCloud_Images/Actions/Create_a_MultiCloud_Image/index.html)
8. Once you create an MCI, you can use it in your ServerTemplates: [Add a MultiCloud Image to a ServerTemplate](http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Dashboard_Users_Guide/Design/ServerTemplates/Actions/Add_a_MultiCloud_Image_to_a_ServerTemplate/index.html)

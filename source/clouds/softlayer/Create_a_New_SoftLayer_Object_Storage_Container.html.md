1. Log into SoftLayer’s Customer Portal.
2. Go to **CloudLayer** > **Object Storage**.
3. (Optional) Select a SoftLayer account (if more than one account is listed).
4. Select the geographic region where the new container will be created. (e.g. Dallas 5)
5. Click **Add Container**.
6. Enter a descriptive name for the container. The name must at least one character long and be a unique name in the selected region. Although you can create containers with the same name in multiple regions, it’s not recommended. Use a simple container name. Although you can use character spaces and underscores in the name, it is recommended that you use simple names with numbers, dashes, and lowercase alpha characters. (e.g. my-db1)

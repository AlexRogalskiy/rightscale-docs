## Overview

Only one RightScale account can be registered for any given SoftLayer account. If other RightScale accounts try to add the SoftLayer account (even with another user/api keys) to their Dashboard, it will not work. So there is a one-to-one relationship with every RightScale account and SoftLayer account.

Additionally, if a customer would like to create additional users, these additional user permissions need to be set correctly to allow instance launches. You can create additional users and set their permissions in the following location after logging in as the admin user:

* **(legacy portal) manage.softlayer.com**: Administrative > User Administration
* **(new portal) control.softlayer.com**: Account > Users

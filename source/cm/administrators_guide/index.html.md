This guide is intended for any person or group who serves as the active administrator(s) for a RightScale account or set of accounts within an organization. It is recommended that you carefully read each section of this guide to ensure that you are following best practices for properly setting up a RightScale account(s) for use within your organization.â€‹

**Prerequisites**: 'admin' user role privileges are required. Only another user with 'admin' privileges can grant another user 'admin' access. If you do not have 'admin' access to the RightScale account, request access from the owner of the account (i.e., the person who created the RightScale account).

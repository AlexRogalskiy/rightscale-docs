## Overview

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that allows you to quickly create a relational database instance in the cloud. Amazon RDS manages the database instance on your behalf by performing backups, handling failover, and maintaining the database software. Amazon RDS supports a number of popular relational database management systems including MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and Amazon's own Aurora. RightScale supports Amazon RDS as part of our overall management platform and is accessible from the RDS browser in the CM dashboard.

RDS customers can choose to either use Amazon RDS (MySQL or Oracle) or our own MySQL solution. In order to use Amazon RDS, you must [sign-up](http://aws.amazon.com/rds/) for the service.

## Overview

The RDS security group controls who has authorized access to the RDS Instance. The two types of authorizations are IP ranges and EC2 security groups. IP range ingress authorizations allow access to DB Instances from the Internet. EC2 security group ingress authorizations allow access to DB Instances from EC2 instances.

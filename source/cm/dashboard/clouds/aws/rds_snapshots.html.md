## Overview

You can manually create RDS Snapshots of a running RDS Instance at any time. An RDS Snapshot is also created automatically when an RDS Instance is terminated. The final snapshot will be denoted as such in its name (e.g. myrds-final-snapshot-timestamp). You can launch any of the archived RDS Snapshots to recreate a specific RDS Instance as it existed when the snapshot was created.

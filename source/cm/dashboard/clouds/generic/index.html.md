## Overview

Many operations performed via the RightScale Cloud Management (CM) Platform are generic in nature regardless of the cloud infrastructure you are using. The look and feel as well as the function performed are identical (or virtually identical). This is because a viable cloud (public or private) must offer certain resources such as compute power, networking, and persistent storage. Generic cloud operations are documented below.

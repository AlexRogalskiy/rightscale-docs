## Overview

VMware vSphere® offers the world’s leading virtualization platform for building cloud infrastructures. The RightScale Cloud Appliance for vSphere (RCA-V) is a stateless web service that presents a compute cloud API on top of VMware vSphere. Its purpose is to enable the RightScale Cloud Management platform to manage a vSphere installation as if it were an on-premise (IaaS) cloud.

Visit our [VMware vSphere](/clouds/vmware/vmware_about.html) page for additional information on supported features and detailed instructions for setting up and configuring your VMware vSphere environment for use in RightScale.

## Overview

**What is a RightScale Deployment?**

A **Deployment** consists of a cluster or group of Servers that work together and share common Input variables and cloud configurations. In a Deployment, you can manage a group of Servers in the same way that you would manage a single Server. You can define common Input variables, execute RightScripts on some or all Servers, as well as create multiple Server environments for production, development, staging, and maybe even failover scenarios. For example, a typical web site deployment consists of two front-end application servers and two back-end, master/slave database servers. At the Deployment level, you can see all of the Servers, the Inputs that are being used, as well as where the values are being inherited from.

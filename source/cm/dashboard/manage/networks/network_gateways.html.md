## Create a Network Gateway### Prerequisites* A Unified Cloud Platform account* 'security_manager' user role privilege### OverviewA network gateway is used to join two or more networks together that use the same protocol. When creating a network gateway in RightScale, you have the option of creating an internet gateway or a VPN gateway. An internet gateway allows public internet access to your VPC. A VPN gateway allows connectivity back to a private network, either on premises or in another VPC (over VPN).### StepsNavigate to **Manage** > **Networks** > **Network Gateways**.![cm-network-manager-show.png](/img/cm-network-manager-show.png)Click **New Network Gateway**.![cm-new-network-gateway-modal.png](/img/cm-new-network-gateway-modal.png)To create your new network gateway, fill out the following fields:* **Cloud**: Specify the cloud your new network gateway will belong to. Your options are AWS and OpenStack clouds.* **Name**: Give your network gateway a name that will be visible in the Network Gateways list.* **Description**: Give your network gateway a description that will be visible when selecting it.* **Type**: Select a network gateway type. Internet gateways direct the network gateways directly to the internet. An *internet* gateway allows public internet access to your VPC. A *VPN* gateway allows connectivity back to a private network.Click **Create**.### Next steps* [Add a Network to a Network Gateway](/cm/dashboard/manage/networks/networks.html)## Delete a Network Gateway### Prerequisites* You need the 'security_manager' user role privilege in your RightScale account.### OverviewWhen you delete a network gateway, you are removing the a network gateway that is set up to either connect with a private network or the public internet. You cannot remove a network gateway if you have a network attached to it.### Steps* Go to **Manage** > **Networks** > **Network Gateways** and select the network gateway(s) you would like to remove.* Click Actions and select **Delete**.* Confirm that this is the network gateway you would like to remove. *Note*: You cannot remove a network gateway if it is attached to a network. You will need to remove the network from the network gateway.* Click **Delete**.## Edit a Network Gateway### Prerequisites* You need the 'security_manager' user role privilege in your RightScale account.### OverviewEditing a network gateway allows you to modify the name and description of the network gateway. You cannot modify any other network gateway information -- such as the network or Resource UID -- after the network gateway has been created.### Steps1. Go to **Manage** > **Networks** > **Network Gateways** and find your network gateway.2. Select your network gateway and click **Edit**.      ![cm-edit-network-gateway.png](/img/cm-edit-network-gateway.png)    * **Name**: The user-defined name of the network gateway.  * **Description**: (Optional) The user-defined description for the network gateway.  * **Type**: Some clouds support multiple Network Gateway types. Internet gateways connect the Network directly to the Internet.  * **Resource UID**: The cloud's unique ID for this resource assigned by the cloud provider.  * **Network**: The name of the network used by the network gateway.  * **State**: Once a VPC is attached, the network gateway's state will be "available"  * **Created At**: The date and time at which the network gateway was created.3. Click **Save**.## Attach a Network to a Network Gateway### Prerequisites* A Unified Cloud Platform account* A previously created network gateway* 'security_manager' user role privilege### OverviewWhen you attach a network to a network gateway, you are joining two networks together. In RightScale, you have the choice of creating an internet gateway or a VPN gateway. An internet gateway allows public internet access to you private network. A VPN gateway allows connectivity to another private network that is either on premises or in another Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).### Steps1. Go to **Manage** > **Networks** > **Network Gateways** and find your network gateway. You can only attach one network to a network gateway. If a network is already connected to a network gateway, you will see it in the **Network** column of the list of network gateways.2. Click Edit and next to **Network** select the network you would like to attach to the network gateway. You will only be able to select networks that are in the same cloud as your network gateway.    ![cm-attach-network-gateway.png](/img/cm-attach-network-gateway.png)  3. Click **Save**. It can take several moments for the network to get connected to the network gateway.

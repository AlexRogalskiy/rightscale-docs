## Overview

The Network Manager allows you to see all the network configurations of your cloud in a single place. Subnets and security groups are some of the network resources that you can manage, create, modify, and delete within a network. You can couple your infrastructure with network resources, such as adding security groups to your instances, to manage the security of your infrastructure. With each network resource, you can view audit entries associated to those resources or you can view the audit entries of your entire network. Additionally, you can view a network map to see the network resources connected to your deployments.

## Overview

End-users interact with the RightScale platform through our HTTP UI and API. When users access RightScale from an internal network, they may be subject to security constraints by firewalls or HTTP proxies.

### Goal

After completing this how-to, you will have configured your network firewall or proxy to allow access to RightScale Web applications.

## Procedure

### Note RightScale-Operated Networks

RightScale operates network infrastructure in several geographical regions to provide fault tolerance. Your instances generally communicate with infrastructure in a nearby geographical region, but may be redirected to remote regions during network or cloud outages.

| Network/CIDR | Location | Description |
| ------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| 54.225.248.128/27 | US-East | us-3 cluster and island1 resources |
| 54.244.88.96/27 | US-West | us-4 cluster and island10 resources |
| 54.86.63.128/26 | US-East | additional island1 resources |
| 54.187.254.128/26 | US-West | additional island10 resources |

### Enable Browser HTTPS Access

You will need to create firewall rules to allow outbound HTTPS to RightScale-operated networks. If using a content-filtering Web proxy, you will need to allow access to URLs/hostnames associated with RightScale management clusters.

| Destination Network/CIDR | Ports | Purpose |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ------- |
| 54.225.248.128/27 | tcp/443 | Send UI and API requests to us-3.rightscale.com |
| 54.244.88.96/27 | tcp/443 | Send UI and API requests to us-4.rightscale.com |
| 54.86.63.128/26 | tcp/443 | Send UI and API requests to us-3.rightscale.com |
| 54.187.254.128/26 | tcp/443 | Send UI and API requests to us-4.rightscale.com |

### What's Next

Your firewall has been configured to allow end users to connect to RightScale. You may now explore the RightScale platform.

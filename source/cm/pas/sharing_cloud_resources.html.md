## Overview

Certain cloud infrastructures support the ability to share cloud resources with either other users or make them available to the public. The ability to share cloud resources is slightly different than sharing RightScale objects because they are objects that are specific to that cloud. You can either share cloud resources using a particular cloud's interface/API or use the RightScale Dashboard. Unlike RightScale objects where you add objects to a particular sharing group and then invite users to the sharing group so that they can use those ServerTemplates, cloud resources must be shared directly to another cloud account or to the general public.

Currently, you can share the following cloud resources inside the Dashboard.

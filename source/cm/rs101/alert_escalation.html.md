## What is an Alert Escalation?

A group of user- or RightScale-defined alert actions, executed in sequential order when their associated alert conditions are continually met for a specified time span. When all alert conditions are not met, the actions associated with the alert escalation stop executing. When the alert conditions are cleared, the resolution action associated with the alert escalation is executed.

More exhaustive information about an Alert Escalation can be found in the [Dashboard Users Guide](/cm/dashboard/index.html) under [Alert Escalations](/cm/dashboard/design/alert_escalations/index.html).

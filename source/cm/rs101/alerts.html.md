## What is an Alert?

A set of conditions defined by RightScale or a user and monitored by the system on a running server. These conditions, when met for a specified minimum time span, can trigger either an autoscaling event or an action or sequential series of actions known as an *alert escalation*.

See [RightScale Alert System](/cm/rs101/rightscale_alert_system.html).

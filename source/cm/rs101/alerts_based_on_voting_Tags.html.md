## Overview

Alerts based on Voting Tags are specifically designed for autoscaling purposes (i.e. growing/shrinking a Server Array by launching/terminating Servers, respectively). Instead of using Alert Escalations, Voting Tags are used to scale up/down a Server Array.

**Note**: The old way of using Alert Escalations for voting purposes will soon be deprecated.

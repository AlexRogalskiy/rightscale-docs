## What is Archiving?

In the context of the cloud and the RightScale management platform, you can archive different objects as a form of clean-up and overall maintenance.

## Why Should I Archive?

The purpose of archiving is to remove an object from your current view so that you can focus on the things that require your immediate attention. Archiving is a way of hiding an object, but not permanently deleting it. The object still exits and can be recalled or unarchived when needed, but the key benefit is that it is no longer cluttering your everyday workspace.

As a best practice, you should archive the objects that you want to save but no longer need to use or access on a regular basis. Each company or team should develop their own set of archiving policies and best practices.

## What Can I Archive?

You can archive deployments, snapshots and End User License Agreements (EULAs).

### What is a MultiCloud Image (MCI)?

A RightScale object used to group and reference similar *machine images* — typically with identical operating systems, operating system versions, and so on — across multiple public and private clouds. MultiCloud Images (MCIs) are key components of ServerTemplates, and indicate which combinations of operating systems, versions, supporting applications, etc., have been tested with a ServerTemplate. They also help users choose a supported software platform for new servers, based on matching machine images already installed on their target cloud.

More exhaustive information about a MultiCloud Image (MCI) can be found in the [Dashboard Users Guide](/cm/dashboard/index.html) under [MultiCloud Images](/cm/dashboard/design/multicloud_images/index.html).

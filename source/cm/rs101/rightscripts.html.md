## What is a RightScript?

An executable script written in Bash, Ruby, Windows PowerShell, or another scripting language. RightScripts run manually from the RightScale Dashboard or API or automatically during a server's boot (startup) or decommission (shutdown) phases. RightScale, RightScale partners, and RightScale users can create RightScripts and publish them individually or as part of a ServerTemplate to the MultiCloud Marketplace.

More information about RightScripts can be found in the [Dashboard Users Guide](/cm/dashboard/index.html) under [RightScripts](/cm/dashboard/design/rightscripts/index.html).

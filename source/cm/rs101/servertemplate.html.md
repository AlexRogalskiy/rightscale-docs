## What is a ServerTemplate?

A RightScale-specific, reusable component that defines the characteristics of a cloud server in a way that is repeatable across multiple servers, clouds, and deployments. A ServerTemplate includes one or more MultiCloud Images used to define an operating system and supporting applications for the server, and a collection of RightScripts or Chef recipes that install select applications and define configuration settings and other attributes.

More exhaustive information about a ServerTemplate can be found in the [Dashboard Users Guide](/cm/dashboard/index.html) under [ServerTemplates](/cm/dashboard/design/server_templates/index.html).

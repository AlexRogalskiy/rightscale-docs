## Overview

* In some cases, you might observe odd/cryptic/gibberish AWS product names in Optima dashboard or billing centers such as:
`d0usxr0lu3gto4qnd6qdule7o` or `2tyyu17icrugeluktpk37i7dp`

## Answer

Those long codes represent codes for purchases from the AWS [Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/help/seller-AMIs?ref=help_ln_sibling).

To discover what these are, simply google search `"AWS"` + `the code`, and you will find out what it is.

For Example:

`d0usxr0lu3gto4qnd6qdule7o` = [https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00EV8VXG2](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00EV8VXG2)

`2tyyu17icrugeluktpk37i7dp` = [https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00PJ9FGVU](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00PJ9FGVU)

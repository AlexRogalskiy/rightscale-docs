## Answer

Yes. RightScale uses your custom EA pricesheet for cost-based features such as cost reporting and recommendations. The pricesheet is automatically connected to RightScale during the [EA agreement connection](/clouds/azure/azure_connect_azure_enterprise_agreement_to_RightScale_for_cost_reporting.html) process.

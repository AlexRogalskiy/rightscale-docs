## Answer

Customers are prompted to define an IP address range (ie. Subnet) within the RightScale Dashboard when registering their Azure cloud credentials. RightScale will create the subnet in the Azure account with the same name as the Virtual Network it is associated with. The subnet must be in the form of CIDR notation (e.g. 10.101.0.0/16).

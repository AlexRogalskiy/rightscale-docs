## Answer

Five is the default number of Virtual Networks you can have, and there is a 1:1 relationship between Virtual Network and Azure region. Currently there are 6 Azure regions available in the RightScale Dashboard. RightScale requires a virtual network for each region. By default Microsoft Azure subscriptions have a maximum of 5 virtual networks they can create. This means that only up to 5 regions can be added to RightScale by default. Please contact Microsoft to request more virtual networks in your subscription if needed.

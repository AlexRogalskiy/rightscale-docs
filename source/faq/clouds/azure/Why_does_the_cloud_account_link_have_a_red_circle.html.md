## Answer

If you go to **Settings > Account Settings > Clouds** in the Dashboard and there is a red circle icon next to the cloud account link, it's because your Azure cloud account has an invalid subscription. (Note: You will need 'admin' privileges in the RightScale account to view this section of the Dashboard.) For example, perhaps the introductory promotional period has ended or the credit card associated with the Azure cloud account is no longer in a billable state. You must resolve the cloud subscription with your cloud provider in order for the cloud account icon to become green again. Once the problem is resolved you will be allowed to launch instances into the cloud from the RightScale Dashboard.

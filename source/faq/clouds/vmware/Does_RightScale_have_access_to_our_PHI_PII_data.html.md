## Background Information

If virtual machines (VMs) in my vSphere environment are launched and managed via the RightScale Dashboard/API, you may wonder if RightScale has access to the actual data stored on those instances.

## Answer

Data, including PHI/PII data stored on virtual machines (i.e. instances) that are managed by RightScale is not stored in the RightScale system. By default, no RightScale employee will have access to the data stored on your instances.

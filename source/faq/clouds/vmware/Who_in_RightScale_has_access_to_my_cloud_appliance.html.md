## Background Information

In order to comply with your company's security policies regarding access to your vSphere infrastructure by third party vendors and/or services, you may need to properly disclose RightScale's level of access to those resources via the RightScale Cloud Appliance for vSphere (RCA-V).

## Answer

By default, no employee of RightScale will have access to your RCA-V and/or vSphere environment. However, at your discretion, you may find it helpful to temporarily grant a RightScale support engineer access to your RCA-V and/or vSphere environment for troubleshooting purposes.

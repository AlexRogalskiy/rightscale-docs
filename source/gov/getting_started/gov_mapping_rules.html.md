title: Mapping Rules

Coming Soon!!!
<!-- Mapping Rules are regular expressions used to map group information extracted from a SAML Assertion through a SAML Provisioning Template to a RightScale Group.

The rules will match your expression to the group membership information from SAML assertion data parsed in the XSL provisioning template. Once matched, the user will be added to the associated RightScale group.

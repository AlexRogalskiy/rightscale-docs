## Overview

Optima allows you to share custom dashboards within your organization.

![shared_dashboards.gif](/img/shared_dashboards.gif)

Dashboards can be accessed in the “Dashboard” tab in Optima. Custom dashboards can be created by anyone, but to share, you must have the `enterprise_manager` permission. All users can have dashboards shared with them, but only users with `enterprise_manager` can share them. 


###Custom Dashboard Creation

When creating a dashboard, you will see a "Visibility" dropdown. Visibility controls how users in your organization will see the dashboard. <br>

<ul>
  <li><b>Private</b> dashboards are only visible to you.
  <li><b>Public</b> dashboards are visible to all users in the organization.
  <li>There is a <b>default</b> dashboard for the dashboard page and another <b>default</b> dashboard for all billing centers; others will see it when viewing dashboards for the first time.</li>
</ul>

###Setting default dashboards

There is a <b>default</b> dashboard for the dashboard page and another <b>default</b> dashboard for all billing centers; others will see it when viewing dashboards for the first time.

####Organization-level

Until otherwise specified, the default dashboard for everyone in the org will be `Flexera Default`. To specify a default dashboard, change that dashboard's <b>Visibility </b> to <i>Default</i> in that dashboard's settings. 

####Billing Center-level

The same dashboard sharing capabilities that apply to the organization level apply here, just to that specific billing center-level.

####Sharing specific dashboards to individual users

!!info*Helpful Tip:* Looking to share a dashboard with a specific user? Every public dashboard has a unique URL, so just share your desired dashboard's link with anyone to direct them right to it.

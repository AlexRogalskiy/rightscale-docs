## Overview

Optima integrates with Azure China by querying [Azure China's Enterprise Billing API](https://docs.azure.cn/en-us/billing/billing-enterprise-api) and downloading and processing customer bills. Once ingested into Optima, the data is made available for pre-built and ad-hoc analyses alongside other public, private, and custom billing data.

To gather cost and usage information from Azure China, certain configuration steps must be performed with specific data and credentials being shared with Optima. This is currently a manual process assisted by Flexera, with an automated onboarding flow to follow in the future. Please contact your Flexera account manager for more details on setting up an Azure China Bill Connect in Optima.

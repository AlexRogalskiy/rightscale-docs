description: This page walks you through the steps to connect Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to Optima for cost reporting purposes.
---

Optima integrates with [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/) billing by querying [OCI Cost Reports](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Billing/Tasks/accessingusagereports.htm) and downloading and processing them. Once ingested, the data is made available in Optima for pre-built and ad-hoc analyses alongside other public, private, and custom billing data.

To gather cost information from OCI, certain configuration steps must be performed with specific data and credentials being shared with Optima. This is currently a manual process assisted by Flexera, with an automated onboarding flow to follow in the future. Please contact your Flexera account manager for more details on setting up an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Bill Connect in Optima.

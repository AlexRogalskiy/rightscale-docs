Optima provides an easy way to analyze cloud costs, but behind the scenes there are a lot of details in the cost ingestion algorithms from each cloud in order to provide these features. This page lists some reference information that may be helpful when doing detailed cost analysis using Optima.

[[Reporting dimensions
Reporting in Optima is done across many "dimensions" of data, such as the cloud, resource type, custom tags, etc. In general dimensions are based off of 3 sources: bill data, RightScale-generated, and custom. The following pages go into detail on each dimension type and the data behind them.

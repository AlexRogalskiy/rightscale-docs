## Overview

RightScale develops capabilities using an agile software development process which allows us to dynamically modify our priorities and features as feedback is received from customers. Our overall strategic roadmap provides a high-level guide for our near term and long term priorities that influences the development teams work and prioritization of customer feedback.

The long-term strategic roadmap is a cross-functional roadmap and provides guidance with high-level targets. Specific features are not determined until development teams begin work within the focus areas and are influenced by customer and industry feedback. 

Near-term targets have more granularity in capability, while long-term targets are more broad.

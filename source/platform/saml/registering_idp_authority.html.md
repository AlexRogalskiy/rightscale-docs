## Overview

In order to prevent Identity Providers from claiming authority over arbitrary email domains, RightScale requires organizations to register which domains their IdPs claim authority over.

To register your IdP for your organization's domain, simply contact your RightScale support representative or account manager and tell them the email domain(s) over which to give your IdP authority. If you do not know your RightScale support representative, please contact [support@rightscale.com](mailto:support@rightscale.com).

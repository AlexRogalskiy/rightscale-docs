## General Questions

### How do I submit my feedback on Policies?

    You can directly talk to the team working on policies by clicking the "Give Feedback" button on the bottom left of the Governance. For reporting issues or bugs, please contact [support@rightscale.com](mailto:support@rightscale.com) directly.

## Custom Policies FAQ

### How do I customize built-in RightScale policies as per my specific requirements? 

    All RightScale policy templates are open source and can be downloaded straight from our public [git repo](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates). You can then modify the code based on your requirements and upload it on the **Templates** before applying it.

### How do I write my own policy?

    Learn more about our policy template language [policy template language](/policies/reference/v20180301/policy_template_language.html) and [find some examples here](/policies/getting_started/custom_policy.html).

### How do I leverage the Policy APIs?
    
    RightScale is an API driven platform. [API docs can be found here](http://reference.rightscale.com/governance-policies/).

### What file extension is recommended for Policy Templates?
    
    We recommend using `.pt` as the file extension for policy templates but it's not a mandatory requirement.

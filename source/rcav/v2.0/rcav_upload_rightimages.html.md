title: Upload RightImages to a vSphere Cloud
description: This article outlines the steps for uploading RightImages to a vSphere Cloud in RCA-V v2.0.
---

## Objective

To upload new machine images (e.g. RightImages) to a vSphere cloud that are specifically designed to launch instances (i.e. virtual machines) via the RightScale Dashboard/API where RightScale's core features such as real-time graphical monitoring, machine tagging, remote script execution, etc. are supported.

## Prerequisites

* Access to log in to the vSphere client console
* vSphere setup with a properly installed RightScale Cloud Appliance for vSphere (RCA-V). See [Download, Deploy, and Configure the RightScale Cloud Appliance for vSphere (RCA-V)](rcav_download_deploy_configure.html).

## Steps

1. Download the image(s) that you want to upload to your vSphere cloud environment. These are equivalent to VM templates.
  * [Linux images](http://rightscale-vsphere.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/) (Link to CentOS and Ubuntu Repository - Use the latest image)
  * Windows 2008R2 and 2012 - Please contact your account rep
2. Open the vSphere Client and choose **File > Deploy OVF Template**.
3. Specify the source location of the OVA file. You can either browse to a locally saved file or enter a URL.

4. Verify the Template's details and click **Next**.
5. **Name and Location**: Provide a name for the image (e.g. RightImage_CentOS_7.0_x64_v14.2_VMware.â€‹) and click **Next**.

    **Recommendation**:  Since RightScale uses the image name to recognize it as RightImage, it is strongly recommended that the default name be used and not change the name of the image.

6. **Host/Cluster**: Choose a datacenter/cluster and click **Next**.
  * **Specific Host**: Choose a specific host within the cluster and click **Next**.
7. **Resource Pool**: (Optional) Select a resource pool (if one exists) and click **Next**.
8. **Storage**: Select a destination storage for the virtual machine (VM) files.
9. **Disk Format**: Specify the format for storing the virtual disks.
  * Choose **Thin Provision** and click **Next**.
10. **Network Mapping**: Specify which networks should be mapped to the instance. You should see both a private and public network. No changes are required. Click **Next**.
11. Once the OVF is deployed, it will appear as a powered-off VM in your vSphere client. Right-click on it, pick **Template->Convert to Template**.

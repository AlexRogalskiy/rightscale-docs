## New Features

* **Login Panel** - We now have a new Dashboard Login Panel with cleaner styling for an improved user experience.
* **OpenStack** - The web socket tunneling software **wstunnel** is now supported for OpenStack. The **wstunnel** server establishes a TCP socket tunnel over a web socket connection.

## Changes in Behavior

* **Search Box** - The search box in the Dashboard header now has expand/collapse functionality.
* **Account Overview** - You can now hide the Getting Started content box on the Account Overview page. Previously, the Getting Started box would always be visible for the first 30 days that a new account was active. Now, clicking the 'close' button on the Getting Started box will dismiss the box.
* **Instance Provisioner** - The Placement Group setting in the Instance Provisioner for Azure cloud is now optional.

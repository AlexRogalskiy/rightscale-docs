## New Features

* **Instance Provisioner**: Availability zones for AWS subnets are now visible in the Subnet Selector within the Instance Provisioner.

## Changes in Behavior

* The Deployment Show Servers (DSS) page (**Manage > Deployments > Servers**) was displaying selected items incorrectly in the overview. This issue has been resolved.
* The Servers page had a bug where the SSH icon would not display. This defect has been fixed.
* There was a bug in the Instance Provisioner which prevented the user from expanding the **Hardware -> Advanced** section. This problem has been addressed.

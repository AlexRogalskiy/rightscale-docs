## Changes in Behavior

* **Removal of Usage Estimate Report** - As part of our continued effort to remove cost information from the Cloud Management Dashboard, we have removed the Usage Estimate Report feature from the dashboard with this release. The Usage Estimate option is no longer accessible from the Reports menu in the dashboard user interface. Customers are encouraged to view costing information for their accounts using RightScale Optima.

## New Features

* **Account Overview** - The Account Overview feature is now enabled for all customer accounts.

* **TSS Monitoring** - We have switched all customer accounts to the new monitoring system â€“ TSS. This change will allow you to do a lot more with your monitoring system data in the future.

**Note**: If you construct your own monitoring URLs you may need to update them. Previously, you could submit data points through collectd by using the hostname `sketchyX-Y.rightscale.com` (e.g., sketchy1-1.rightscale.com). With TSS, new instances will be assigned to `tssX-Y` instead of `sketchyX-Y`. You will now have to submit your data points to `tss-collectdX-Y.rightscale.com`. This change does not impact those using our RightScript/Recipe without modification, nor does it impact instances that are still assigned to the legacy sketchyX-Y.

## New Features

* **CM API 1.5 - New Sessions Resource View** - We have introduced a new “whoami” view to the API 1.5  Sessions resource that provides a link to the currently logged-in user (or instance) and to the account they are interacting with. This is useful for OAuth clients who may be given a refresh token without knowing to whom it belongs. For more information, see [http://reference.rightscale.com/api1.5/resources/ResourceSessions.html#index](http://reference.rightscale.com/api1.5/resources/ResourceSessions.html#index)

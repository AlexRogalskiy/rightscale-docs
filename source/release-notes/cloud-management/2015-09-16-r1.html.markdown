## New Features

* **Network Manager** - Outbound security group rules are now supported for Openstack in Network Manager.

* **API 1.5 - Spot Pricing** - Allowing the specification of Spot or On-Demand pricing for Server and ServerArray resources via API 1.5 adds further flexibility in selecting the best instance pricing for a given workload. While already available in the Cloud Management user interface, this feature extends this functionality into API 1.5. Read more about it in the API docs here: [http://reference.rightscale.com/api1.5/index.html](http://reference.rightscale.com/api1.5/index.html).

* **Customization - Logo Support** - Cloud Management now provides a setting for organizations to change the top-left logo in the Cloud Management and Optima interfaces to your own custom logo.

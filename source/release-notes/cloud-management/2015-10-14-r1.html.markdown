## New Features

* **Google Compute Engine - Stop/Start** - We have added support for Stop/Start for instances on Google Compute Engine. Note that any instance terminated directly in Google Compute Engine will show as "stopped" in RightScale since they can be restarted. 

* **CM API 1.5 - Private IP Address** - This new feature adds the ability to specify a private IP address when creating or updating the next instance of a Server resource. While currently available in the Cloud Management user interface, this feature extends the functionality into CM API 1.5.

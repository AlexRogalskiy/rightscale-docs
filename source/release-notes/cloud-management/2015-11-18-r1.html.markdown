## New Features

* **Google GCE - Local SSDs** -  RightScale now supports local SSDs on GCE instances. When launching a supported instance, simply choose how many SSDs to attach. Each local SSD provides 375GB of storage and is deleted when the instance is terminated. See [Create and Launch a New GCE Instance](/cm/dashboard/clouds/google/google_add_instance.html) for additional information.

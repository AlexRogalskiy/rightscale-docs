## New Features

* **GCE Instance Types** - We have added support for GCE instance types that exist only in specific regions (specifically: n1-highcpu-32, n1-highmem-32, n1-standard-32).

## Changes in Behavior

* Changes to security group rules are now audited in more detail, including the exact fields of the rule that was created/removed, the author of the change, and the resulting security group definition.

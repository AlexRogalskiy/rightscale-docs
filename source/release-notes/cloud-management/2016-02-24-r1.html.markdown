## New Features

* **Google Compute Engine** - GCE Subnetworks are now discovered and can be used when creating and launching servers, arrays, and instances in GCE. Networks and their subnets are shown in Network Manager, however they can not be managed there today â€“ they must first be created/configured in GCE. Any of those subnets can be used when managing servers, arrays, and instances through the CM Dashboard, CM API 1.5, and Self-Service CAT files.
* **MultiCloud Images** - The MCI image selector now allows filtering on image metadata such as ID.

## Changes in Behavior

* **AWS API Requests** - We have updated the backoff algorithm used when AWS throttles API requests.
* **Deprecation of old Servers tab** In 2013, we released a new version of our Servers tab for a deployment, while allowing you the option to switch back to the older version. This release removes the option to use the legacy Server tab for a deployment and all accounts will automatically switch to the new version of the Servers tab.

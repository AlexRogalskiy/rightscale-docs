## CM API 1.5 Change Log

**Modified Resources**

* **Permissions**
  * Permissions IDs have changed from being a unique numeric ID for the resource to containing a combination of ***user ID*** and ***role title*** (example: `user_id-role_title`). [See API documentation for details](http://reference.rightscale.com/api1.5/resources/ResourcePermissions.html)

## New Features

* **Change to the way instance names are set in GCE and Azure**. With this release, the name of the Server/Array in RightScale is used as the instance name in those clouds, after it's been sanitized per cloud limitations. By default, a unique ID is still appended to ensure uniqueness on the cloud, but this can be disabled using an account setting by going to `Account` -> `Preferences`.
* Added support to **choose the root volume type** for GCE instances. Use any supported volume type via the UI, API, and CAT files.    
* Added **support for I2 instance types in AWS-Beijing**.

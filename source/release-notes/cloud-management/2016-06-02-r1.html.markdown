## New Features

* **OpenStack Liberty Support**. OpenStack Liberty is now a supported private cloud in RightScale. All of the major capabilities of OpenStack that are supported by RightScale are available with Liberty. Read more about RightScale's support for OpenStack [on our docs site](/cm/dashboard/clouds/openstack/).
* Added a new field to instances that indicate whether or not they were **provisioned by** RightScale.

## Changes in Behavior

* Changed the way that the platform gets password data for AWS instances -- if AWS responds with a `403 Permission Denied`, the platform now gives up instead of retrying the call.

## New Features

* Improved Managed Login functionality for RightLink 10.5 and higher. With the new managed login feature, RightLink 10 leverages an open-source NSS plugin to authorize users from RightScale roles (`server_login` and `server_superuser`) and authenticate users using their keys stored in RightScale. Every user has a system-provided login name and can create a "preferred" login name in their User Settings under SSH. Read more on the [RightLink 10 Managed SSH Login page](/rl10/reference/rl10_managed_ssh_login.html).

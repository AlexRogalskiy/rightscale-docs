## New Features

* Improved support for install-at-boot for RightLink 10 when an instance is behind a proxy. The `rs_agent:mime_shellscript` tag can be used to provide a proxy-aware environment to run the install script. Read more on the [RightLink 10 Proxying page](/rl10/reference/rl10_proxying_rightlink.html).

## Changes in Behavior

* Fixed a bug that caused some attributes set by API calls to not show correctly in the UI.

## New Features

* **Support for new Azure Regions and Azure India** - RightScale now supports the additional regions recently added by MS Azure, West US 2 and West Central US as well as Azure India. [Re-register your Azure Resource Manager subscriptions](/clouds/azure_resource_manager/getting_started/register.html) to get access to these new regions.

## Changes in Behavior

* Fixed a bug that was preventing proxy tags on an MCI from being inherited by Servers

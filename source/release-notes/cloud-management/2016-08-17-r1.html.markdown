## New Features

* **Premium Storage Accounts are now supported** in RightScale - they can be managed via the Cloud Management UI and API as well as included in CAT files in Self-Service. Read more about [using Azure Storage Accounts here](/clouds/azure_resource_manager/reference/resources.html#storage-accounts).

## Changes in Behavior

* Fixed a bug that cause some support emails sent from the Cloud Management UI to bounce
* Fixed an issue where starting a stopped server would sometimes cause the server to be stuck in the `booting` state

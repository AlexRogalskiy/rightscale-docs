## Changes in Behavior

* Added new `destroy` action to the [Alerts resource in CM API 1.5](http://reference.rightscale.com/api1.5/resources/ResourceAlerts.html#destroy), allowing you to remove Alerts from servers entirely
* The [Clouds.index call in CM API 1.5](http://reference.rightscale.com/api1.5/resources/ResourceClouds.html#index) can now be made by users with the `instance` role (i.e., RightLink 10 instance credentials)
* Deprecated CloudFront Distributions and CloudFront Origin Access Identities from Cloud Management per our [End of Life policy](/faq/end_of_life_end_of_service.html#schedule-other)

## New Features

* **Support for P2 Instance Types** when launching servers on AWS. Note that the pricing information has not yet been updated in Optima, so Instance Analyzer might show incorrect costs for these instances.
* **Azure Placement Group Tags now sync** between RightScale and Azure Resource Manager. Use the tag predicate `azure` in RightScale to create a tag that syncs to the cloud. More resource tag sync functionality is coming soon.

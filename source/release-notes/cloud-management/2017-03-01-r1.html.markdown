## New Features

* Improved **integration with Azure Resource Groups**, allowing you to launch resources through RightScale into user-specified new or existing Resource Groups in Azure. Associate any RightScale Deployment with any Azure Resource Group so that resources in the Deployment exist in the associated Resource Group. Read more about [this integration in the docs site](/clouds/azure_resource_manager/reference/resources.html#azure-resource-groups).

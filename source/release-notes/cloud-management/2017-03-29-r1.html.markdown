## New Features

* Google Virtual Machines can now be launched **using images from another project** if the current project has appropriate read access to those images. In order to take advantage of this, you will [need to whitelist the source projects](/clouds/google/google_connect_gce_to_rightscale.html#adding-images-from-other-projects) in RightScale.
* The [registration process for Azure Resource Manager](/clouds/azure_resource_manager/getting_started/register.html#connect-microsoft-azure-resource-manager-to-your-rightscale-account) **has been greatly simplified** and no longer requires the user to provide the tenant or subscription ID.
* Added **support for AWS i3 instance types** to Cloud Management, Self-Service, and Optima

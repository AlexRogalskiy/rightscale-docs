## Changes in Behavior

### API 1.5
* By default, the `VolumeAttachments.create` call in the API behaves synchronously, blocking until the volume is attached. An `api_behavior=async` attribute was added to the [VolumeAttachments create](http://reference.rightscale.com/api1.5/resources/ResourceVolumeAttachments.html#create) call, allowing you to make the call and then poll for status.
* Added `skip_deletion='true'` to [Backups cleanup](http://reference.rightscale.com/api1.5/resources/ResourceBackups.html#cleanup). The cleanup action will return a list of backups that can be removed without removing them.

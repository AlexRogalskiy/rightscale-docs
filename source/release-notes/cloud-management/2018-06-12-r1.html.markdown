## New Features

* Azure Resource Manager subscriptions can now be registered with Cloud Management **using an Azure Active Directory Application** of your choosing. This provides full control over the security principle that RightScale uses to interact with your subscriptions and is available via Cloud Management API 1.5. [Read more about how to register your subscriptions here](/clouds/azure_resource_manager/getting_started/register_using_ad_application.html).

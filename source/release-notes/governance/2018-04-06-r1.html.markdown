## New Feature

* Introducing a new dedicated role (`credential_viewer`) for **view-only** permissions on RightScale's [Credentials](/cm/dashboard/design/credentials/) feature. You no longer have to grant `admin` role to view credentials. The `credential_viewer` role can be assigned to users at an organization level (all accounts), as well as to individual accounts, like other Governance roles.

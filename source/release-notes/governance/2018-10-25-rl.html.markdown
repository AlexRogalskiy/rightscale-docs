## New Features

* Policies now include the option to approve actions prior to execution. Users have the ability to add an approval action as part of escalation or resolution. The [`Approval` API](https://reference.rightscale.com/governance-policies/#/Approval) creates an approval request and blocks further actions from executing until a user approves or denies the action. Parameters can be referenced by subsequent cloud workflows or emails within the same escalation or resolution. Users with policy_approval role can approve or deny an action with the ability to add a comment, the details of which can be seen on the Incident details page as well as the api.

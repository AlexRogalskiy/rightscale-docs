## New Features

The [`fpt` command-line tool](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_sdk/tree/master/cmd/fpt) has been released which provides policy developers with an improved workflow to build, test, and deploy policies across their organization. More information on the tool and policy development in general can be found in the [policies getting started guides](/policies/getting_started).

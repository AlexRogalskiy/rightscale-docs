## Changes in Behavior

Policy **incidents are now archived** after 30 days if there is nothing actionable and the incident is `terminated` or `resolved`. Archived incidents can still be [found in the API](https://reference.rightscale.com/governance-policies/#/ArchivedIncident/ArchivedIncident_index) if additional information is needed. Read more about [incidents on the docs page](/policies/#basic-concepts-incident).

## New Policies

* [AWS Delete Unused Classic Load Balancers](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/tree/master/cost/aws/elb/clb_unused) identifies any unused CLBs and allows them to be deleted after user approval.

* [Cheaper Regions](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/tree/master/operational/aws/vpc_name_sync) reports on usage in regions where there is a less expensive, geographically similar region that could be used instead.

## New Policies

* [Stranded Servers](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/operational/stranded_servers) reports on any servers that are stranded in booting so that they can be repaired or terminated to reduce waste.

## Changes to Existing Policies

* [Cheaper Regions](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/cost/cheaper_regions) policy now reports only on instance data instead of all region costs, helping to simplify the report and help users target relevant spend.
* [Unattached Volumes](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/cost/volumes/unattached_volumes/README.md) now provides an option to take a snapshot of the volume before deleting it.

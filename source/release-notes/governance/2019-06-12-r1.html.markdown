## Changes to Existing Features

* Policies **now support pagination markers in the body** of a request, enabling the use of APIs that leverage this method for pagination, such as some AWS API calls. You can find additional information and examples of the `body_field` page marker in the Pagination section of the [policy language documentation](/policies/reference/v20180301/policy_template_language.html#retrieving-data-api-data-with-datasources).

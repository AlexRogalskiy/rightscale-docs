## New Policies

* [Azure Instance Utilization using Log Analytics](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/cost/azure/instances_log_analytics_utilization) uses performance metrics from Azure Log Analytics from the last 30 days to identify underutilized instances.

* [Unapproved instance types](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/compliance/unapproved_instance_types) reports on any instances that are running using instance types that are not in a pre-approved list of instances provided by the user.

## New Policies

* [Superseded Instances](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/tree/master/cost/superseded_instance) checks for instances running on instance types that have been superseded by newer, usually improved, instance types.

## Changes to Existing Policies

* [AWS Instance CloudWatch Utilization](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/tree/master/cost/aws/instance_cloudwatch_utilization/) now supports tags to ignore instances, minimum usage thresholds for reporting, and actions to tag the resources that fail the policy check.

* [Low Account Usage](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/tree/master/cost/low_account_usage) can now be run against specific billing centers, supports a minimum savings threshold to limit the noise, and reports against the monthly run rate instead of the current usage.

* [Low Service Usage](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/tree/master/cost/low_service_usage) can now be run against specific billing centers, supports a minimum savings threshold to limit the noise, and reports against the monthly run rate instead of the current usage.

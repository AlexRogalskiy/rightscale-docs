## New Features

* Cloud workflow now [supports JWT tokens](/ss/reference/rcl/v2/ss_RCL_functions.html#miscellaneous-jwt_encode) when making [http calls](/ss/reference/rcl/v2/ss_RCL_functions.html#http-https-functions) so that any API that uses JWT can be leveraged when remediating policy incidents or automating cloud resource actions.

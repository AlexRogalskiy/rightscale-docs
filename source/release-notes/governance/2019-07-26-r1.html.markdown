## New Policies

* [Azure VMs Not Using Managed Disks](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/operational/azure/vms_without_managed_disks/README.md) checks all Azure VMs and reports on any that are not using Managed Disks, which are the latest offering from Azure and are much easier to manage.
* [AWS S3 Buckets without Server Access Logging](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/security/storage/aws/s3_buckets_without_server_access_logging/README.md) checks for any S3 buckets that don't have Server Access logging enabled and allows the user to enable logging after approval.
* [Azure Subscription Access](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/compliance/azure/subscription_access/README.md) checks all users who have Owner or Contributor access to a given Azure subscription and creates an incident whenever that user list changes.

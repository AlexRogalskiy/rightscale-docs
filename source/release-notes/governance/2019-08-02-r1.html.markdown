## Changes to Existing Policies

* [AWS Instance CloudWatch Utilization](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/cost/aws/instance_cloudwatch_utilization/README.md) now supports Windows instances as well if Cloudwatch is configured appropriately (see the readme for configuration details).
* [AWS Reserved Instances Recommendation](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/cost/aws/reserved_instances/recommendations/README.md) corrected an error that caused only the first page of recommendations to show.

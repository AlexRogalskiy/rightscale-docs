## New Policies

* [AWS Unencrypted S3 Buckets](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/security/aws/unencrypted_s3_buckets/README.md) checks all S3 buckets in the AWS account and reports on any that do not have default encryption set, allowing the user to set encryption settings for the bucket or delete it after manual approval.

## Changes to Existing Policies

* [Low Service Usage](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/cost/low_service_usage/README.md) has been changed to more closely meet the data provided in Optima Recommendations.

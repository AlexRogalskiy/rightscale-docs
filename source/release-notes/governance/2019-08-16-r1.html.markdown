## Changes to Existing Policies

* [Superseded Instances](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/cost/superseded_instance/README.md) was updated to show the monthly estimated cost for each instance instead of the run rate.
* [Cheaper Regions](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/cost/cheaper_regions/README.md) was updated to show the resource IDs of affected virtual machines.
* [Old Snaphots](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/cost/volumes/old_snapshots/README.md) was updated to always send an email when new snapshots are detected.

* [AWS Burstable Instance CloudWatch Utilization](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/cost/aws/burstable_instance_cloudwatch_credit_utilization/README.md) recommends instance type changes based on Cloudwatch utilization data for burstable instance types.
* [Okta Inactive Users](https://github.com/flexera/policy_templates/blob/master/saas/okta/inactive_users/README.md) identifies users that have not logged in within the specified number of days and optionally deactivates the users after approval.

## Changes to Existing Policies

## Changes to Existing Policies

* Multiple policies were modified to include a manual approval step before taking action so that items can be reviewed before being modified. Manual approval for any policy can be skipped by checking the ["Skip Action Approvals"](/policies/users/guides/apply_policy.html#common-policy-configuration-options--skip-action-approvals-) option when applying a policy.
* Multiple policies were modified such that they are now limited to only being applied to only one account. This limitation is appropriate in cases where the policy uses an external credential for authentication and running the policy on multiple accounts would lead to the exact same behavior repeated numerous times.

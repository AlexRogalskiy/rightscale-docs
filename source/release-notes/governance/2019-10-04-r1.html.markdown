## New Policies

* [Azure Instances not running FlexNet Inventory Agent](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/compliance/azure/instances_without_fnm_agent/README.md) checks for any instances in Azure not running the agent so that you can ensure full license coverage across your compute landscape.
* [FlexNet Manager Licenses At Risk](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/compliance/fnms/fnms_licenses_at_risk/README.md) provides a report of all licenses at risk according to FlexNet Manager.

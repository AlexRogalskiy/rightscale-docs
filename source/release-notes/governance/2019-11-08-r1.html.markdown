## New Policies

* [AWS Savings Plan Recommendations](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/cost/aws/savings_plan/recommendations/README.md) uses the AWS Cost Explorer to raise incidents if AWS recommends any Savings Plan purchases where the savings is more than the specified threshold.
* [AWS EC2 Instances not running FlexNet Inventory Agent](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/compliance/aws/instances_without_fnm_agent/README.md) reports on any instance running in EC2 that does not have the FlexNet Inventory Agent installed.
* [Azure Migrate Integration](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/operational/azure/azure_migrate/README.md) collects the resources from a RISC Foundations assessment and seeds Azure Migrate with the discovered servers.

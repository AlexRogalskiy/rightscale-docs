## New Features

* Policies now have **credential management** built-in to the product, making it easier to connect your different clouds for policy governance. Along with the feature release, many policies have been upgraded to use the new credential capability (see below). [Check out the docs to learn more](/policies/users/guides/credential_management.html). Some of the benefits include:
  * Simplified experience to connect clouds for policy governance
  * Ability to rotate credentials without affecting running policies
  * Support for new credential types including AWS Cross-Account Roles and NTLM
  * Reduced overhead when dealing with multiple cloud accounts
* Policy designers can now specify a **default frequency** value [in their policies](/policies/developers/reference/v20180301/policy_template_language.html#metadata), simplifying the process of applying a policy for their users.

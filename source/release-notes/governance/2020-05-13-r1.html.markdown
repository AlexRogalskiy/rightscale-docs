## New Features

* The Policy Manager has an improved incident table.  The new incident table allows users to sort columns, hide and show columns and filter for text within the table.  This feature requires the use of the [export block](/policies/developers/reference/v20180301/policy_template_language.html#describing-the-policy-conditions) within the policy template.

## New Policies

* [SaaS Manager - Inactive Users](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/saas/fsm/inactive_users_by_dept) create an incident when Flexera SaaS Manager identifies inactive or never active users for managed applications.
* [SaaS Manager - Redundant Apps](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/saas/fsm/redundant_apps) create an incident when Flexera SaaS Manager identifies application categories with an excessive number of applications.
* [FlexNet Manager Low Available Licenses](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/compliance/fnms/fnms_low_licenses_available) creates and incident when Flexnet Manager Licenses with available count less than user provide percentage.

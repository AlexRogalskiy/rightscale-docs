## New Policy Templates

* [Policy Updates](https://github.com/flexera/policy_templates/blob/master/compliance/policy_update_notification) Be informed of updated policy templates in the Policy Catalog.  This policy template identifies the version of all the policies that are applied in an account and compares them to the version of respective policy template in catalog. It further creates an incident providing details on when the policy was last updated in catalog and the link to README and CHANGELOG files.

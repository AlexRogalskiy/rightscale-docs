## New Features

* Added a new date picker for `Tabular` view in Billing to provide additional controls over the granularity and timeframe shown in the table.

* Recommendations in billing centers can now be "ignored", helping to reduce the noise by providing a way for non-applicable recommendations to be hidden for users. Users with the `billing_center_admin` or `enterprise_manager` roles are able to ignore and restore recommendations.

## Changes in Behavior

* When in a billing center, changing the breakdown dimension dropdown no longer resets the page to the current month -- the currently selected month remains selected.

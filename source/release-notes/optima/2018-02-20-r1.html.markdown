## New Features

* Added the year to the tabular view column header to make it easier to tell which month you're seeing when looking at long time periods..

* The top-level `Tabular View` is now available to all users (it was previously only available to users with access to all org data). Now users with access to individual billing centers can also use this feature as a rollup of information across all billing centers they have access to.

## Changes in Behavior

* The default "cost type" is now amortized, unblended for new users to the system.

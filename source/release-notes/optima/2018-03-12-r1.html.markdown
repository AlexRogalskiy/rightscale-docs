## New Features

* New and improved Dashboard page has been released -- new features include the ability to slice by different dimensions, improved performance, support for showing amortized costs, consistency with billing center data, and a spend-by-day line chart. One important change is that permissions to the data shown in Dashboard are now determined by **billing center permissions**, instead of by access to RightScale accounts. Also, the new Dashboard does not show which accounts are linked to which RightScale accounts, and for each cloud account only the ID is shown, not the cloud account name.

**NOTE: This is a Release Candidate, the latest GA release is [10.0.3](/release-notes/right-link-10/2015/03/31.html)**

(This Release Candidate is virtually identical to 10.0.3 except that the ServerTemplate has images for 7 operating systems on 4 clouds making it much easier to try out the install-at-boot use-cases than 10.0.3 and making it easier to refer to a known-to-work image if you're having difficulties.)

For additional detail and documentation on this release, please refer to the following [release notes.](/rl10/releases/rl10_10.0.rc4_release.html)

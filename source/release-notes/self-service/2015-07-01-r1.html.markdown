## New Features

**Introducing CloudApp Permissions** - The permissions required to launch and operate a CloudApp in Self-Service are now captured in the CAT itself and can be delegated to users with lower levels of permission. This allows you to build complex CloudApps that can be launched by anyone on your team without worrying about giving them explicit permissions on all the resources in the CAT. Older CloudApps that use the legacy permissioning model are labeled as such in the Catalog for Designers so that they can be updated.

## Changes in Behavior

* Text inputs now support multi-line entry. Just hit `enter` or paste in text and the text input will grow as needed.

## New Features

**Permissions Actions** - Added new permissions actions specifically for the "sensitive" view of Credentials and SSHKeys resources. This means that you no longer need the "admin" role to publish CATs that contain those resources. The new actions are called `index_sensitive` and `show_sensitive`.

**Deferred CloudApp Launch** - You can now choose to defer launching of a CloudApp if you've selected a schedule that is outside of the current time. Simply choose the *Launch CloudApp at next scheduled start* option on the *Launching CloudApp* screen and your CloudApp will be launched at the scheduled start time rather than immediately. For more information, see the *Select a Schedule when Launching a CloudApp* section in the [Self-Service Creating Schedules Guide](/ss/guides/ss_creating_schedules.html).

## Changes in Behavior

* Fixed a bug that was preventing parameter descriptions from showing on the launch modal.

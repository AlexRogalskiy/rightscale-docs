## New Features

* **Account Selector** - We've added an Account Selector control to the header in the Self-Service UI to make it easy to switch to a different Self-Service enabled account in any shard. See [Account Selection](/ss/guides/ss_user_interface_guide.html#account-selection) in the Self-Service User Interface Guide for additional information.

## Changes in Behavior

* Fixed a bug that would sometimes select other CloudApps in index view after a period of time.

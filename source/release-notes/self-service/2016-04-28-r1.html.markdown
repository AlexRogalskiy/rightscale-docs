##Changes in Behavior##

* **CloudApp Description Change**: the description of a CloudApp is no longer populated with the `short_description` from the CAT. Previously, if a user launched a CloudApp and didn't set a description, the system would copy the `short_description` from the CAT -- this is no longer the case.
* Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented user time zone settings from being saved 
* Fixed a bug related to selecting days when editing an existing Schedule in Designer 
* Fixed a bug that would sometimes show an error growler when deleting a CloudApp

## New Features

* **CAT Imports** is now available, allowing you to create *package* CATs that can be imported into other CATs, enabling code reuse and best practices implementation. You can read more about how it works on the [Packaging CATs docs page](/ss/guides/ss_packaging_cats.html). Please note that this requires using a new CAT Version and associated RCL Version that both contain **breaking changes**. Details on the changes are listed on the [CAT Changelog](/ss/reference/cat/changelog.html) and the [RCL Changelog](/ss/reference/rcl/changelog.html) pages.
* Support for escaped characters and shorthand classes in RCL regex

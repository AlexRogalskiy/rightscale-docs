## Changes in Behavior

* Improved the support drop-downn (when clicking your name in the UI) to include more information and an easier method to create support tickets
* The "Next Action" now includes custom scheduled actions, in addition to the lifecycle actions that have always been shown
* Implemented performance improvements for CloudApp runtime operations, particularly impactful when using `call` frequently to call other definitions

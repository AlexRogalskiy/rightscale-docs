## New Features

* Introducing support for [bulk resources in CAT](/ss/guides/ss_bulk_resources.html), allowing CAT designers to easily specify resources with many "copies" and efficiently launch and manage them
* [Custom provision functions](/ss/reference/cat/v20161221/index.html#resources-provisioning-resources) are now available, providing authors with a built-in method for customizing the provisioning of any CAT resource
* The above and more are available in [a new CAT version](/ss/reference/cat/changelog.html#version-20161221) (`20161221`)

## Changes in Behavior

* See the [new CAT version](/ss/reference/cat/changelog.html#version-20161221) documentation for changes in the new version - existing versions are unaffected

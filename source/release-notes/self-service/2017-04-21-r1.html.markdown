## New Features

* [Self-Service Plugins](/ss/guides/ss_plugins.html) are now available, allowing you to **integrate and manage any service** through Self-Service CAT files. Integrate with any service from any cloud or service provider by defining a `plugin` in your CAT and publishing the application to the Catalog.

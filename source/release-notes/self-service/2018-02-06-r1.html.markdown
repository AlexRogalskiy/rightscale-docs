## Changes in Behavior

* Added support for the `encrypted` field for [volume resources](/ss/reference/cat/v20161221/ss_CAT_resources.html#resources-volume) in CAT. 
* The cred() function in both [CAT](/ss/reference/cat/v20161221/index.html#built-in-methods-and-other-keywords) and [RCL](/ss/reference/rcl/v2/ss_RCL_functions.html#miscellaneous-cred) now chooses exact match before failing over to partial match

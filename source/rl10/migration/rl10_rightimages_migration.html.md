To help in the migration of ServerTemplates, RightLink 10 images can be created to replace older RightLink 5 and 6 images, also known as RightImages. The [Image Bundler For RightLink 10](/st/rl10/image-bundler/index.html) ServerTemplate can be used to create these images. A [tutorial](/st/rl10/image-bundler/tutorial.html) is available, giving details on creating images and updating MCIs.

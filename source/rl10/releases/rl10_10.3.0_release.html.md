description: Version-specific information for the 10.3.0 Release of RightLink.
---

10.3.0 is a major GA release that brings support for Windows Azure cloud (classic), CoreOS, Linux Base Monitoring, and Custom Monitoring. This release includes:

### Features
1. Add custom [monitoring](/rl10/reference/rl10_monitoring.html) script support that is compatible with collectd exec style plugin scripts.
2. Add support for UCA on Windows
3. Add [Docker](/rl10/reference/rl10_docker_support.html) monitoring and tagging
4. Added numerous metrics to "all" category for built-in monitoring:
 * df-MOUNT/(df_complex-free,df_complex-used)
 * disk-DEVICE/(disk_merged,disk_octets,disk_ops,disk_time)
 * swap/(swap-free,swap-used)
 * swap_io/(swap_io-in,swap_io-out)
 * processes/(fork_rate, ps_state-blocked, ps_state-paging, ps_state-running, ps_state-sleeping, ps_state-stopped, ps_state-zombies)
 * interface-NAME/(if_octets, if_errors, if_packets)
 * memory/(memory-used, memory-free)
 * Fixed cpu-N/cpu-irq to be cpu-N/cpu-interrupt

### Fixes
1. Improve userdata fetcher service bundled with Windows to skip scraping userdata if we already have valid credentials
1. Fixed memory leak in which goroutine would be left behind after running an operational script
1. Fixed agent not starting up if localhost is not defined or incorrect
1. Bump rightscale networking scripts to v1.0.1. Fixes installation on CentOS/vSphere if selinux is disabled
1. Update install and enable scripts to handle CoreOS filesystem setup
1. Remember the level of built-in monitoring across RightLink service restarts
1. Add in doppelganger detection for EC2 by killing duplicate launches
1. Update service configs to use current format of /var/lib/rightscale-identity
1. Only add BOM on Powershell scripts that do not have one already
1. Fixed service failing to start when disabling then enabling an instance on CentOS/RHEL 7
1. Fixed final audit entries being cut short for upgrade script on occasion
1. Do not turn on utilization monitoring by default
1. Fixed boot bundle sometimes not running after stop/start due to stale state file on Windows 2008R2

## RightScale tested images

The following images were tested by RightScale and known to work with this version of RightLink 10. This list is not intended as a recommendation of these images, it is simply intended as a reference so you can locate known-to-work images and compare with your own images if you are having difficulties.

"Known to work" means that the following features work: enable a running "bare" instance using the rightlink.enable.sh or rightlink.enable.ps1 script, reboot the instance, stop and start the instance, create the rightscale user and support managed login (Linux only), install the RightLink 10 init scripts, and install monitoring (collectd on Linux).

Note: except for VMware the tests for this release use official images prepared by the OS vendor or the cloud vendor. In some cases this leads to failures due to problems with the specific images that can easily be overcome using a custom image.

## How-To

### Quick Test (Linux Only)

* From the marketplace import the [RightLink 10.3.0 Linux Base ServerTemplate](https://www.rightscale.com/library/server_templates/RightLink-10/lineage/53250) published by RightScale Engineering.
* Create a Server from the ServerTemplate
* Select an appropriate MCI and launch. Once the server goes operational, you will see an audit entry with the boot scripts and be able to SSH into the instance using your "managed SSH" key as the user 'rightscale' from which you can sudo (see [Server Login Control](/cm/rs101/server_login_control.html) for additional information on "managed SSH" keys)

### Adapting the Base ServerTemplate
* You can clone the base ST and insert a different MCI of your choice, the MCI needs to have the required rs_agent tags (see below)
* Alternatively, you can create you own ST using your own MCI
* Standard MCI tags (see [RightLink 10: Cloud-init](../reference/rl10_install_at_boot.html) for additional tags for Linux):

    `rs_agent:type=right_link_lite`</br>
    `rs_agent:mime_include_url=https://rightlink.rightscale.com/rll/10.3.0/rightlink.boot.sh`
    <br>(for Install-at-boot on Linux)

* AWS, Softlayer, Openstack Juno, Google, and RCA-V (vSphere) have been tested; Other images on other clouds with a functioning cloud-init should work, but have not been explicitly tested by RightScale (see above).
* The [Enable Monitoring RightScript](https://github.com/rightscale/rightlink_scripts/blob/master/rll/enable-monitoring.sh) will install collectd on Ubuntu and RHEL/CentOS/Compatible OSes, and will use RightLink Monitoring on CoreOS.  It could strand on other distros as there may be no support to install collectd via packages. Installation of collectd was verified with CentOS 6, CentOS 7, Ubuntu 12.04, and 14.04 but should work on other versions as well, and use of RightLink Monitoring has been tested with CoreOS stable.
* Please see [RightLink on CoreOS](/rl10/reference/rl10_rightlink_on_coreos.html) if adapting the Base ServerTemplate for CoreOS.

## RightLink 10 is Not Fully Compatible with RightLink6

* The environment variables available to RightScripts are different, and there are no RS_REBOOT or RS_OS_TYPE variables. Write idempotent scripts using the capabilities of the shell, such as testing for the presence of files. Dispatch based on the presence of tools or file system locations you need instead of a OS type variable.
* No rs_tag command, instead RightLink 10 can proxy API 1.5 requests and add authentication along the way
* No built-in Chef support
* RightScript log output is not sanitized to remove credential values! (Some of them are by the platform but this will change soon.) The sanitization has lots of problems, the only proper solution is for the script writer to ensure sensitive credentials are not output to stdout/stderr!
* For a full list of changes see [Incompatibilities with RightLink 6](../reference/rl10_incompatibilities_with_rl6.html)

description: Version-specific information for the 10.5.2 Release of RightLink.
---

10.5.2 is a point release for the last major GA release ([10.5.0](rl10_10.5.0_release.html)).  This release includes:

###Features
1. The RightScale Network Agent set of configuration scripts for RCA-V installation can be disabled by passing the '-n' option to rightlink.install.sh or the -NoNetworkingScripts option to rightlink.install.ps1. These scripts have also been updated to not install for the enablement and install-at-boot use cases where functioning network connectivity is a prerequisite
2. Added support for passing open_stack_v3 as a cloud_type for enablement on Openstack (Liberty)
3. Added reference/example alerts to both the Linux and Windows RightLink 10 ServerTemplates
4. Added a new RightScript for both Linux and Windows that will enumerate the network interfaces from the current server and add/update the alerts to reflect the correct interface naming
5. Updated our documentation to include additional specifics around the actions the RightScale Network Agent installers take on the system
6. Add support for a shebang on Windows to specify extra command line flags for PowerShell such as -Version 2.0, the shebang must be the first line of the RightScript, for example #!powershell -Version 2.0

###Fixes
1. Update attachment libnss_rightscale.tgz for rll/enable-managed-login.sh to work for users with very low rightscale ids (< 500)
2. Update to no longer mark the state or secret files for deletion on Windows. This was found to interfere with some Microsoft installers (MS SQL 2016). RightLink checks if the state file was created before the system boot time to determine the booting state on Windows
3. Fixed an issue where the Server could fail to post audit entry updates grater than 5 MB in size
4. Fixed a possible raise condition where the RightLink state file did not always reflect the current state before a required service restart (Docker monitoring). This could cause the boot scripts to run a second time or for a stranded server to go operational
5. Updated to go 1.7 to resolve an issue with timeouts from the RightLink10 local proxy
6. Update to both Linux and Windows enablement scripts to use UUID to locate servers for Windows Azure RM
7. Update to enable-managed-login.sh script to supress benine error ourput
8. Update to allow a reboot during the boot script execution which will now stop execution of further scripts and not enter a stranded or operational state until the subsequent boot
9. Update to avoid exit code 143 (sigterm) for RightScripts on upstart-based systems by putting them in their own process group

## RightScale tested images

The following images were tested by RightScale and known to work with this version of RightLink 10. This list is not intended as a recommendation of these images, it is simply intended as a reference so you can locate known-to-work images and compare with your own images if you are having difficulties.

"Known to work" means that the following features work: enable a running "bare" instance using the rightlink.enable.sh or rightlink.enable.ps1 script, reboot the instance, stop and start the instance, support managed login (Linux only), install the RightLink 10 init scripts, and install monitoring (collectd on Linux).

Note: except for VMware the tests for this release use official images prepared by the OS vendor or the cloud vendor. In some cases this leads to failures due to problems with the specific images that can easily be overcome using a custom image.

## How-To

### Quick Test (Linux Only)

* From the marketplace import the [RightLink 10.5.2 Linux Base ServerTemplate](https://www.rightscale.com/library/server_templates/RightLink-10/lineage/53250) published by RightScale Engineering.
* Create a Server from the ServerTemplate
* Select an appropriate MCI and launch. Once the server goes operational, you will see an audit entry with the boot scripts and be able to SSH into the instance using your "managed SSH" key with your default or custom login name (see [Server Login Control](/cm/rs101/server_login_control.html) for additional information on "managed SSH" keys)

### Adapting the Base ServerTemplate
* You can clone the base ST and insert a different MCI of your choice, the MCI needs to have the required rs_agent tags (see below)
* Alternatively, you can create you own ST using your own MCI
* Standard MCI tags (see [RightLink 10: Cloud-init](../reference/rl10_install_at_boot.html) for additional tags for Linux):

    `rs_agent:type=right_link_lite`</br>
    `rs_agent:mime_shellscript=https://rightlink.rightscale.com/rll/10.5.2/rightlink.boot.sh`
    <br>(for Install-at-boot on Linux)

* AWS, Softlayer, Openstack Juno, Google, and RCA-V (vSphere) have been tested; Other images on other clouds with a functioning cloud-init should work, but have not been explicitly tested by RightScale (see above).
* The [Enable Monitoring RightScript](https://github.com/rightscale/rightlink_scripts/blob/master/rll/enable-monitoring.sh) will install collectd on Ubuntu and RHEL/CentOS/Compatible OSes, and will use RightLink Monitoring on CoreOS.  It could strand on other distros as there may be no support to install collectd via packages. Installation of collectd was verified with CentOS 6, CentOS 7, Ubuntu 12.04, and 14.04 but should work on other versions as well, and use of RightLink Monitoring has been tested with CoreOS stable.
* Please see [RightLink on CoreOS](/rl10/reference/rl10_rightlink_on_coreos.html) if adapting the Base ServerTemplate for CoreOS.

## RightLink 10 is Not Fully Compatible with RightLink6

* The environment variables available to RightScripts are different, and there are no RS_REBOOT or RS_OS_TYPE variables. Write idempotent scripts using the capabilities of the shell, such as testing for the presence of files. Dispatch based on the presence of tools or file system locations you need instead of a OS type variable.
* No rs_tag command, instead RightLink 10 can proxy API 1.5 requests and add authentication along the way
* No built-in Chef support
* RightScript log output is not sanitized to remove credential values! (Some of them are by the platform but this will change soon.) The sanitization has lots of problems, the only proper solution is for the script writer to ensure sensitive credentials are not output to stdout/stderr!
* For a full list of changes see [Incompatibilities with RightLink 6](../reference/rl10_incompatibilities_with_rl6.html)

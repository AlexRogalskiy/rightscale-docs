!!warning*Warning!*RightLink 6 [has been EOL'd](/faq/end_of_life_end_of_service.html#schedule-images-rightlink) - please refer to the [RightLink 10 documentation](/rl10)

There are three ways to consume RightLink 6:

* The first and more common is use RightImages. RightImages come pre-installed with RightLink 6 or older and are
available for every cloud and OS combination.
* The second way is to create your own RightImages by installing RightLink into a fresh or snapshotted image. To do this, please read the
[Installing RightLink 6](rl6_installing.html) guide.
* The third way is by enabling an existing running instance. This method is only supported for Windows and with the
latest agent. It is not recommended to use this method anymore for RightLink 6. [RightLink 10](/rl10/) now supports
enablement of both Windows and Linux and is less intrusive, more lightweight, and better supported. For the legacy
RightLink 6 enablement documentation, see [Enabling Existing Workloads with RightLink 6](rl6_enabling.html)

## Why Update Set vs Store?

In order for an integration to be accepted into the ServiceNow Store, it must go through a certification process with ServiceNow. Due to the investment and time required for such a certification, we only periodically certify our releases. Every released is **fully tested** and **fully supported** by RightScale per your support agreement.

* **Simplify Application Management by Empowering Cloud Users** - Enable cloud users to perform automated operations such as launching, deleting, or sizing up an application. Streamline maintenance through the entire lifecycle of cloud applications.
* **Drive Down Spend with Built-In Cost Controls** - Manage costs by setting quotas for users and teams. Eliminate waste through scheduled shutdowns during non-working hours or at project end.
* **Reduce Risks with Policy-Based Governance** - Enable safe and secure cloud consumption with a centralized, policy-driven service catalog. Set policies for available clouds, instance types, and operations.
* **Gain Control of Cloud Usage and Reduce “Shadow IT”** - Deliver self-service access to cloud infrastructure to the entire organization. Define access controls for cloud usage; enforce corporate technology standards; and control security patches and configurations.

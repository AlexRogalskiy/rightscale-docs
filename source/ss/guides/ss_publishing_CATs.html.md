4. Any **Name** can be entered for the Catalog, and the **Short Description** and **Long Description** can either be copied from the CAT, from a previous version of the published CloudApp, or you can enter a new one. Press the **Markdown supported** link to get hints on markdown syntax. The **Catalog Preview** will show a preview of the CloudApp as it will appear in the Catalog.

5. Optionally, choose a **Runtime Schedule**, then click **Yes, Publish CloudApp**. Your CAT file will be published and listed as an available CloudApp in the Catalog view. See [Creating Schedules](ss_creating_schedules.html) for additional information on setting up and managing CloudApp schedules.

title: Cloud Application Templates
---

The Cloud Application Template, or CAT, is the file format that is used to describe every application in the Self-Service Catalog. It has an associated language that is declarative and is used to describe the various inputs, outputs, resources, and operations available for the application. A CAT file can contain any number of Resources -- such as Servers, Arrays, SecurityGroups -- and also defines the Outputs that are shown to the users of Self-Service.

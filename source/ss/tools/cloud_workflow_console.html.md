## Introduction

This Cloud Worflow Console (**CWF**) Console provides the ability to execute RightScale Cloud Workflow code (RCL) directly against the **CWF** engine without having to use a CAT file. **CWF Console** only works with RCL code, you can't paste in an entire CAT (it doesn't take any declarations). Plugins `cannot` be tested in the **CWF Console**

## Permissions Required

 The [ss_designer](/cm/ref/user_roles.html#-ss_designer) role is required to access CWF console

## Accessing the CWF Console

  * Click on **Designer** on the left panel. 
  * Click on **CWF Console** to the right of `Designer`

## Tips
  * If you want to see the value of a variable/resource, `return` it from your main definition â€“ it will show up as an "Output" when the process is over. Alternatively, you could use a global variable (`$$`) or resource collection (`@@`) and it will show up while the process is running on the `Process Info Tab`.
